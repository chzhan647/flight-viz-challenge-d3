These operations, which carry thousands of passengers for compensation or hire each year, are not held to the same maintenance, airworthiness, and operational standards as air carrier, commuter and on demand, and air tour operations conducted under 14 CFR Parts 121, 135, and 136, respectively. This investigation focuses on the following categories of revenue passenger-carrying operations conducted under Part 91: exception from 14 CFR Part 119, exemption from certain Part 91 and 119 requirements, omission from Part 119 and other commercial regulations, and exploitation of Part 119 regulatory loopholes. Members of the public who pay to participate in Part 91 revenue passenger-carrying activities are likely unaware that these operations have less stringent requirements than other commercial aviation operations. As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board makes six new safety recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration.","2021-04-13T04:00:00Z","FAA | Open - Acceptable Response | NA;

At this location, US-101 has six southbound traffic lanes, including a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) exit lane to State Route 85 (SR-85) southbound on the far left. As the SUV approached the US 101/SR-85 interchange, it was traveling in the lane second from the left, which was an HOV lane for continued travel on US-101.

As the SUV approached the paved gore area dividing the main travel lanes of US-101 from the SR-85 left exit ramp, it moved to the left and entered the gore area. The SUV continued traveling through the gore area and struck a nonoperational crash attenuator at a speed of about 71 mph. The crash attenuator was positioned on the end of a concrete median barrier. The impact rotated the SUV counterclockwise and caused the front body structure to separate from the rear of the vehicle. The Tesla was involved in subsequent collisions with two other vehicles, a 2010 Mazda 3 and a 2017 Audi A4.

During the collision sequence, the Tesla’s high-voltage battery was breached and a postcrash fire ensued. After the crash, bystanders found the driver in his seat with his lap/shoulder belt buckled. They removed him from the vehicle before it was engulfed in fire. The driver was transported to a local hospital, where he died from blunt force trauma injuries. The driver of the Mazda sustained minor injuries, and the driver of the Audi was uninjured.

The vessel, with 53 people on board, was on a scheduled transit to an offshore casino boat, the Tropical Breeze I, located about 9 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Shortly before 1600, the Island Lady captain received a high-temperature alarm for the port engine’s jacket-water system. He notified the vessel’s operating company, Tropical Breeze Casino Cruz, and turned the Island Lady around to return to the dock. During the return trip, smoke began filling the lazarette, main deck spaces, and engine room. The captain deliberately beached the vessel close to shore in shallow water. All passengers, crewmembers, and company employees evacuated the vessel by entering the water and wading/crawling ashore. The Port Richey Police Department, Pasco County Sheriff’s Office, Port Richey Fire Department, and US Coast Guard responded to the fire. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Tarpon Springs Police Department, Dunedin Police Department, and Pinellas County emergency services also provided aid. Fifteen people were injured and transported to local hospitals; one of them, a female passenger, died in the hospital hours after the fire. Drug and alcohol testing was conducted on the crewmembers; all results were negative. No pollution was reported. Damage was estimated to be less than $500,000; therefore, a major marine casualty was not declared. The NTSB investigated the accident under Title 49 United States Code 1131 (a)(1)(f)(ii) as an accident of recurring character because of a similar fire on board another of the operating company’s vessels, the Express Shuttle II, in 2004. 
From its investigation of this accident, the NTSB identified safety issues in the following areas: 
•	• Lack of company guidance regarding engine high-temperature alarms 
•	• Lack of fire detection in unmanned spaces with exhaust tubing 
•	• Insufficient preventive maintenance 
•	• Insufficient crew training and documentation 
•	• Inappropriate material and design of fuel tank level-indicator system

"H-18-029","Highway",,"Washington","District of Columbia","","Motorcyclists—motorcycle riders and their passengers—have the highest risk of fatal injury among all motor vehicle users. In 2016, 5,286 motorcyclists died in traffic crashes in the United States (NCSA 2018). Per mile traveled, motorcyclist fatalities occurred nearly 28 times more frequently than passenger vehicle occupant fatalities in traffic crashes (NCSA 2018). Like accidents across all modes of transportation, motorcycle crashes are complex events that can be influenced by multiple human, vehicle, and environmental factors. However, because motorcycles afford riders less protection, the likelihood of injuries and fatalities in a crash is much greater. In this safety report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) assesses select risk factors associated with the causes of motorcycle crashes in the United States and makes recommendations for improving motorcycle crash prevention.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provided the data analyzed in this report from its 2016 Motorcycle Crash Causation Study (MCCS). The MCCS represents the most recent data available for studying motorcycle crashes and risk factors in the United States since the US Department of Transportation published its comprehensive Motorcycle Accident Cause Factors and Identification of Countermeasures report in 1981. The NTSB analyzed the MCCS crashes involving a motorcycle with an engine displacement that exceeded 50 cubic centimeters or a maximum design speed above 31 mph, and at least one reported injury sustained by the motorcycle rider or passenger. All crashes occurred in Orange County, California, between 2011 and 2015. The NTSB’s research goals were to (1) identify and assess factors that contribute to motorcycle crash risk, (2) compare these factors with previous research findings about motorcycle crash risk, and (3) evaluate the need for motorcycle safety improvements.","2018-10-02T04:00:00Z","NHTSA | Open - Acceptable Response | NA;

The accident occurred at milepost 477, on the Black Hills subdivision, in Edgemont, South Dakota. The three-member roadway work group had been cleaning snow and ice from the track switch on the main track to prepare for the movement of a train that was to have its air brake system tested in a stationary test on the main track. The crew of the striking train sounded the train horn and bell, and both members of the train crew applied emergency braking; however, there was no response from the roadway work group, and the train was unable to stop before reaching the work location. At the time of the accident, the sky was clear, the wind was calm, and reported temperatures ranged from 13° to 18°F.
The accident occurred in the west leg of the Deadwood wye switch. Train movements on the main tracks in this area are controlled by centralized traffic control and governed by operating rules, general orders, timetable instructions, and the signal indications of an absolute block system.
The Black Hills subdivision consisted of two main tracks. The maximum operating speed was 35 mph between milepost 476.1 and milepost 477.0 on both main tracks. About 20 eastbound and 20 westbound trains per day operated on the main tracks through the accident area. There were multiple main tracks in this area with eastbound trains typically operating on main track 2 and westbound trains operating on main track 1.
This report addresses the following safety issues:
•	Train Approach Warning. The investigation found that the sight distance at the Deadwood wye switch was inadequate for the safe use of the train approach warning method of on-track safety when using a single watchman/lookout. The watchman/lookout was not devoting his full attention to detecting approaching trains. In addition, in the year prior the accident, none of the members of the roadway work group were tested on the visual detection of trains.
•	Watchman/Lookout Equipment. The investigation found that the watchman/lookout involved in this accident was not provided with the necessary equipment, such as a whistle, air horn, white disk, red flag, or fusee, to perform on-track safety duties, as required by federal regulations. The absence of on-track safety warning equipment likely allowed the watchman/lookout to engage in other work activities, rather than his assigned duty?watching for trains.
•	Roadway Worker-in-Charge to Roadway Work Group Job Briefings. The investigation found that the job briefing conducted by the watchman/lookout and the other roadway workers in the work group fouling the track had incorrect information regarding the minimum-required sight distance and the required time to move to the predetermined place of safety.","2018-09-05T04:00:00Z","FRA | Open - Unacceptable Response | NA;

The accident occurred at milepost 477, on the Black Hills subdivision, in Edgemont, South Dakota. The three-member roadway work group had been cleaning snow and ice from the track switch on the main track to prepare for the movement of a train that was to have its air brake system tested in a stationary test on the main track. The crew of the striking train sounded the train horn and bell, and both members of the train crew applied emergency braking; however, there was no response from the roadway work group, and the train was unable to stop before reaching the work location. At the time of the accident, the sky was clear, the wind was calm, and reported temperatures ranged from 13° to 18°F.
The accident occurred in the west leg of the Deadwood wye switch. Train movements on the main tracks in this area are controlled by centralized traffic control and governed by operating rules, general orders, timetable instructions, and the signal indications of an absolute block system.
The Black Hills subdivision consisted of two main tracks. The maximum operating speed was 35 mph between milepost 476.1 and milepost 477.0 on both main tracks. About 20 eastbound and 20 westbound trains per day operated on the main tracks through the accident area. There were multiple main tracks in this area with eastbound trains typically operating on main track 2 and westbound trains operating on main track 1.
This report addresses the following safety issues:
•	Train Approach Warning. The investigation found that the sight distance at the Deadwood wye switch was inadequate for the safe use of the train approach warning method of on-track safety when using a single watchman/lookout. The watchman/lookout was not devoting his full attention to detecting approaching trains. In addition, in the year prior the accident, none of the members of the roadway work group were tested on the visual detection of trains.
•	Watchman/Lookout Equipment. The investigation found that the watchman/lookout involved in this accident was not provided with the necessary equipment, such as a whistle, air horn, white disk, red flag, or fusee, to perform on-track safety duties, as required by federal regulations. The absence of on-track safety warning equipment likely allowed the watchman/lookout to engage in other work activities, rather than his assigned duty?watching for trains.

"H-17-018","Highway","2015-04-15T04:00:00Z","Washington","District of Columbia","","Speeding—exceeding a speed limit or driving too fast for conditions—is one of the most common factors in motor vehicle crashes in the United States. In this safety study, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) examines causes of and trends in speeding-related passenger vehicle crashes and countermeasures to prevent these crashes.

From 2005 through 2014, crashes in which a law enforcement officer indicated a vehicle’s speed was a factor resulted in 112,580 fatalities, representing 31% of all traffic fatalities. Speeding or speed has been cited as a safety issue, or a causal or contributing factor in 49 major NTSB highway accident investigations since 1967. Although recent speeding-related NTSB investigations have primarily involved large trucks and buses, most speeding-related crashes involve speeding passenger vehicles. In 2014, passenger vehicles constituted 77% of speeding vehicles involved in fatal crashes, and 78% of all speeding-related fatalities involved a speeding passenger vehicle. This study leverages prior NTSB investigations, together with other research, to address the national safety issue of speeding among passenger vehicle drivers.

In this study, the NTSB used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to summarize the risks of speeding, describe the scope of the problem, and promote the use of proven and emerging speeding countermeasures. This included a literature survey; analyses of speeding-related crash data; and interviews with national, state, and local traffic safety stakeholders. The stakeholders were representatives from transportation and highway safety agencies, law enforcement agencies, automobile manufacturers, research institutions, advocacy groups, equipment vendors, personal auto insurance providers, and professional associations.

In this safety study, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) examines causes of and trends in speeding-related passenger vehicle crashes and countermeasures to prevent these crashes.

From 2005 through 2014, crashes in which a law enforcement officer indicated a vehicle’s speed was a factor resulted in 112,580 fatalities, representing 31% of all traffic fatalities. Speeding or speed has been cited as a safety issue, or a causal or contributing factor in 49 major NTSB highway accident investigations since 1967. Although recent speeding-related NTSB investigations have primarily involved large trucks and buses, most speeding-related crashes involve speeding passenger vehicles. In 2014, passenger vehicles constituted 77% of speeding vehicles involved in fatal crashes, and 78% of all speeding-related fatalities involved a speeding passenger vehicle. This study leverages prior NTSB investigations, together with other research, to address the national safety issue of speeding among passenger vehicle drivers.

In this study, the NTSB used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to summarize the risks of speeding, describe the scope of the problem, and promote the use of proven and emerging speeding countermeasures. This included a literature survey; analyses of speeding-related crash data; and interviews with national, state, and local traffic safety stakeholders. The stakeholders were representatives from transportation and highway safety agencies, law enforcement agencies, automobile manufacturers, research institutions, advocacy groups, equipment vendors, personal auto insurance providers, and professional associations.

In this safety study, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) examines causes of and trends in speeding-related passenger vehicle crashes and countermeasures to prevent these crashes.

From 2005 through 2014, crashes in which a law enforcement officer indicated a vehicle’s speed was a factor resulted in 112,580 fatalities, representing 31% of all traffic fatalities. Speeding or speed has been cited as a safety issue, or a causal or contributing factor in 49 major NTSB highway accident investigations since 1967. Although recent speeding-related NTSB investigations have primarily involved large trucks and buses, most speeding-related crashes involve speeding passenger vehicles. In 2014, passenger vehicles constituted 77% of speeding vehicles involved in fatal crashes, and 78% of all speeding-related fatalities involved a speeding passenger vehicle. This study leverages prior NTSB investigations, together with other research, to address the national safety issue of speeding among passenger vehicle drivers.

In this study, the NTSB used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to summarize the risks of speeding, describe the scope of the problem, and promote the use of proven and emerging speeding countermeasures. This included a literature survey; analyses of speeding-related crash data; and interviews with national, state, and local traffic safety stakeholders. The stakeholders were representatives from transportation and highway safety agencies, law enforcement agencies, automobile manufacturers, research institutions, advocacy groups, equipment vendors, personal auto insurance providers, and professional associations.

This study assessed speeding among passenger vehicle drivers in a broad sense, as a factor that contributes to crashes and injury severity.

The oversize combination vehicle had a permit for the route of travel and was being led by a pilot/escort vehicle, a 1997 Dodge Ram pickup truck. As the oversize combination vehicle traveled across the I-5 bridge above the Skagit River, its oversize load struck the bridge, damaging the structure. As a result of contact damage to the bridge’s truss structure, span 8 of the 12-span bridge collapsed into the Skagit River. Two passenger vehicles, a southbound 2010 Dodge Ram pickup truck towing a Jayco travel-trailer and a northbound 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek, fell into the river. Eight vehicle occupants were involved in the collapse; three received minor injuries and five were uninjured. 
Safety issues identified during the investigation included the following: permitting and route surveying for oversize loads; pilot/escort vehicle operations, guidelines, and driver training; commercial driver operations for transporting oversize loads; state practices for high load bridge strikes; and requirements for low-clearance signage.","2014-08-04T04:00:00Z","District of Columbia | Open - Unacceptable Response | NA;

The bus was traveling north on Burlington County Road (BCR) 660 through the intersection with BCR 528, while a Herman’s Trucking Inc. 2004 Mack roll-off1 truck with a fully loaded dump container was traveling east on BCR 528, approaching the intersection. The school bus driver had stopped at the flashing red traffic beacon and STOP sign. As the bus pulled away from just forward of the white stop line on BCR 660 and entered the intersection, it failed to yield to the truck and was struck behind the left rear axle. The bus rotated nearly 180 degrees and subsequently struck a traffic beacon support pole. One bus passenger was killed. Five bus passengers sustained serious injuries, 10 bus passengers and the bus driver received minor injuries, and nine bus passengers and the truck driver were uninjured. 
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determines that the probable cause of the Chesterfield, New Jersey, crash was the school bus driver’s failure to observe the Mack roll-off truck, which was approaching the intersection within a hazardous proximity. Contributing to the school bus driver’s reduced vigilance were cognitive decrements due to fatigue as a result of acute sleep loss, chronic sleep debt, and poor sleep quality, in combination with, and exacerbated by, sedative side effects from his use of prescription medications. Contributing to the severity of the crash was the truck driver’s operation of his vehicle in excess of the posted speed limit, in addition to his failure to ensure that the weight of the vehicle was within allowable operating restrictions. Further contributing to the severity of the crash were the defective brakes on the truck and its overweight condition due to poor vehicle oversight by Herman’s Trucking, along with improper installation of the lift axle brake system by the final stage manufacturer—all of which degraded the truck’s braking performance. Contributing to the severity of passenger injuries were the nonuse or misuse of school bus passenger lap belts; the lack of passenger protection from interior sidewalls, sidewall components, and seat frames; and the high lateral and rotational forces in the back portion of the bus.","2013-09-09T04:00:00Z","NHTSA | Open - Unacceptable Response | NA;

Although single-unit trucks comprise three percent of registered motor vehicles and four percent of miles traveled, they are involved in nine percent of fatalities among passenger vehicle occupants in multivehicle crashes. Crashes involving single-unit trucks and passenger vehicles pose a hazard to passenger vehicle occupants due to differences in weight, bumper height, and vehicle stiffness.2 
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) undertook this study because of concerns about the safety record of single-unit trucks and an interest in identifying countermeasures to address the risks posed by these vehicles. Single-unit trucks are excluded from some safety rules applicable to tractor-trailers. Single-unit trucks do not have to meet the requirements for improved rear underride guards (mandatory in 1998 for new trailers) and conspicuity treatments to enhance visibility (mandatory in 1993 for new trailers; in 1997 for new truck-tractors; and in 2001 for trailers manufactured before 1993). Further, in 2012, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed mandating electronic stability control for tractor-trailers and motorcoaches but not for single-unit trucks. 
Many studies of truck safety have examined fatalities as the sole outcome of interest. Tractor-trailers result in a larger proportion of fatal injuries from large truck crashes, which is one reason why some truck safety regulations have been limited to tractor-trailers and trailers. However, this study shows that there are substantial societal impacts resulting from non-fatal injuries arising from single-unit truck crashes. Emergency department visits, inpatient hospitalizations,3 and hospital costs4 that result from the crashes provide measures of the adverse effect of non-fatal injuries on the public. This study also shows that federal and state databases frequently misclassify single-unit trucks and thus undercount the total number of fatalities resulting from single-unit truck crashes by approximately 20 percent. 
The primary focus of this study was on the risks of single-unit truck crashes, and these risks were compared with those of tractor-trailer crashes. This study used a variety of data sources. Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES) data, which links hospital discharge records with police accident reports, were obtained from five participating states (Delaware, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Utah) and served as the primary source of data for injury severity and hospitalizations in relation to truck and accident characteristics. Additional databases used include Trucks in Fatal Accidents (TIFA) and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) (fatal crashes); the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS)/General Estimates System (GES) (national estimates of non-fatal injuries); and the Large Truck Crash Causation Study (LTCCS) (truck crash investigations with details not available from the other sources). 
To improve the quality and accuracy of CODES data, the NTSB developed and used a program to decode truck vehicle identification numbers (VIN); this program was used in conjunction with VIN-derived gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) supplied by NHTSA. Additionally, the CODES staff used statistical procedures to impute missing values for critical variables in the data sent to the NTSB and thereby maximize the data available for analysis. This approach avoids the bias introduced by omitting records with missing values. This comprehensive approach resulted in a detailed characterization of single-unit truck crash types and the associated fatalities and injuries.","2013-07-03T04:00:00Z","NHTSA | Open - Unacceptable Response | NA;

"H-13-001","Highway","2012-06-28T04:00:00Z","","","USA","The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has long been concerned about alcohol-impaired driving, which accounts for approximately one-third of all US highway fatalities. In the past several decades, awareness of the dangers of alcohol-impaired driving has increased. Public and private entities focusing on this safety issue have changed social perceptions concerning alcohol-impaired driving; they have also achieved important legislative actions to help reduce it. Due to these efforts, the number of lives lost annually in alcohol-impaired-driver-related crashes declined 53 percent, from 21,113 in 1982 to 9,878 in 2011; and the percentage of highway fatalities resulting from alcohol-involved crashes is down from 48 percent in 1982 to about 31 percent today. 
In recent years, however, US success in addressing this safety issue has plateaued. Since 1995, although the annual number of fatalities has declined, nearly one in three of all highway deaths still involves an alcohol-impaired driver. The cause of these deaths is well understood and preventable, yet even the most concerted efforts have not kept thousands of lives from being lost each year. If traditional methods are no longer reducing the problem, new—and possibly challenging—initiatives must be considered. 
In this safety report, the NTSB— 
• Describes the scope of the impaired driving problem; 
• Summarizes the efforts of advocacy groups, researchers, law enforcement agencies, traffic safety groups, public health organizations, legislators, and motor vehicle agencies, as well as federal, state, and local governments, to reduce the number of crashes, injuries, and fatalities;

"H-13-005","Highway","2012-06-28T04:00:00Z","","","USA","The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has long been concerned about alcohol-impaired driving, which accounts for approximately one-third of all US highway fatalities. In the past several decades, awareness of the dangers of alcohol-impaired driving has increased. Public and private entities focusing on this safety issue have changed social perceptions concerning alcohol-impaired driving; they have also achieved important legislative actions to help reduce it. Due to these efforts, the number of lives lost annually in alcohol-impaired-driver-related crashes declined 53 percent, from 21,113 in 1982 to 9,878 in 2011; and the percentage of highway fatalities resulting from alcohol-involved crashes is down from 48 percent in 1982 to about 31 percent today. 
In recent years, however, US success in addressing this safety issue has plateaued. Since 1995, although the annual number of fatalities has declined, nearly one in three of all highway deaths still involves an alcohol-impaired driver. The cause of these deaths is well understood and preventable, yet even the most concerted efforts have not kept thousands of lives from being lost each year. If traditional methods are no longer reducing the problem, new—and possibly challenging—initiatives must be considered. 
In this safety report, the NTSB— 
• Describes the scope of the impaired driving problem; 
• Summarizes the efforts of advocacy groups, researchers, law enforcement agencies, traffic safety groups, public health organizations, legislators, and motor vehicle agencies, as well as federal, state, and local governments, to reduce the number of crashes, injuries, and fatalities; 
• Examines the effect of alcohol consumption on an individual’s ability to operate a motor vehicle and on the risk of being involved in a crash; and 
• Evaluates the effectiveness of current and emerging alcohol-impaired driving countermeasures and identifies new approaches and actions needed to reduce and ultimately eliminate alcohol-impaired driving.","2013-06-03T04:00:00Z","Commonwealth of Puerto Rico | Open - Unacceptable Response | NA;

The pilot, flight nurse, flight paramedic, and patient were killed, and the helicopter was substantially damaged by impact forces. The emergency medical services (EMS) helicopter was registered to Key Equipment Finance, Inc., and operated by Air Methods Corporation, doing business as LifeNet in the Heartland, as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 medical flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and a company visual flight rules flight plan was filed. The helicopter was not equipped, and was not required to be equipped, with any onboard recording devices. The flight originated from Harrison County Community Hospital, Bethany, Missouri, about 1811 and was en route to GPH to refuel. After refueling, the pilot planned to proceed to Liberty Hospital, Liberty, Missouri, which was located about 7 nautical miles (nm) from GPH. 
The helicopter impacted the ground in about a 40° nose-down attitude at a high rate of descent with a low rotor rpm. Wreckage examination determined that the engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion and that the fuel system was operating properly. The investigation revealed that the pilot did not comply with several company standard operating procedures that, if followed, would have led him to detect the helicopter’s low fuel state before beginning the first leg of the mission (from the helicopter’s base in St. Joseph, Missouri, to Harrison County Community Hospital). After reaching the hospital, the pilot reported to the company’s EMS communication center that he did not have enough fuel to fly to Liberty Hospital and requested help locating a nearby fuel option. During their conversation, the pilot did not report and the communication specialist did not ask how much fuel was on board the helicopter, and neither of them considered canceling the mission and having fuel brought to the helicopter. After determining that GPH was the only airport with Jet-A fuel along the route of flight to Liberty Hospital, the pilot decided to proceed to GPH, although the estimated flight time to GPH was only 2 minutes shorter than that to Liberty Hospital. The engine lost power about 1 nm short of the airport, and the pilot did not make the flight control inputs necessary to enter an autorotation, which resulted in a rapid decay in rotor rpm.","2013-05-06T04:00:00Z","FAA | Open - Unacceptable Response | NA;

The goal of this investigative project is to identify relevant safety recommendations to prevent wrong-way collisions on such highways and access ramps. The investigations included in this report take a focused view of the driver and highway issues affecting wrong-way collisions. 

The report is organized into four sections. Section 1, ""Wrong-Way Collisions,"" defines the problem, examines the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) history with these types of collisions and generally surveys the data and research concerning wrong-way driving collisions. Section 2, ""NTSB Investigations,"" summarizes nine NTSB wrong-way collision investigations. Section 3, ""Characterization of Wrong-Way Driving,"" considers the components of wrong-way collisions and uses data, research, and NTSB investigative work to summarize these types of collisions. Section 4, ""Countermeasures,"" provides recommendations to address wrong-way collisions. Those countermeasures are organized to address the following safety issues: 

Driver impairment, primarily from alcohol use, with consideration of older driver issues and possible drug involvement 
The need to establish—through traffic control devices and highway design—distinctly different views for motorists approaching entrance and exit ramps 
Monitoring and intervention programs for wrong-way collisions

"H-12-033","Highway","2012-05-15T04:00:00Z","Washington","District of Columbia","USA","The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has long been concerned about alcohol-impaired driving, which accounts for approximately one-third of all US highway fatalities. Between 1982 and 1994, the percentage of fatally injured drivers with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) greater than or equal to 0.08 decreased from 49 to 33 percent. However, since that time, there has been no further decline in the percentage, and efforts are needed to address this lack of progress. The NTSB has issued more than 120 safety recommendations on impaired driving since 1968, and “Addressing Alcohol-Impaired Driving” is on the NTSB’s Most Wanted List. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that alcohol-impaired driving in the United States continues to kill over 10,000 people yearly and to injure many more despite numerous federal, state, and local efforts.
The NTSB is also concerned about the growing problem of drug use by drivers. According to NHTSA, from 2005 to 2009, the proportion of fatally injured drivers who tested positive for drugs (illicit, prescription, and over-the-counter) rose from 13 to 18 percent. According to NHTSA’s 2007 National Roadside Survey, 16.3 percent of weekend nighttime drivers tested positive for drugs. The growing prevalence of drugged driving has also captured the attention of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which cites the following principle in its 2011 National Drug Control Strategy: “Preventing drugged driving must become a national priority on par with preventing drunk driving.” 
In May 2012, the NTSB held a forum to identify the most effective, scientifically based actions needed to “reach zero” accidents resulting from substance-impaired driving. Numerous impaired driving countermeasures were discussed at the forum, including laws, enforcement strategies, adjudication programs, substance treatment programs, ignition interlocks, passive alcohol detection systems, and educational campaigns. Presenters discussed the merits and drawbacks of various countermeasures, as well as the challenges to reducing impaired driving. Reductions in accidents and injuries attributable to impaired driving are the ultimate measures of success. However, inadequate data collection and reporting in many states continue to limit our ability to understand and address the problem of impaired driving and to measure the effectiveness of countermeasures.","2012-11-21T05:00:00Z","NHTSA | Closed - Acceptable Action/Superseded | 1/12/2023;

Contributing to the accident was the absence of a positive train control system that identifies the rear of a train and stops a following train if a safe braking profile is exceeded. Contributing to the severity of collision damage to the locomotive cab of the striking coal train was the absence of crashworthiness standards for modular locomotive crew cabs.","2012-05-10T04:00:00Z","Association of American Railroads | Open - Acceptable Response | NA;

"H-11-039","Highway","2010-08-05T19:11:00Z","Gray Summit","Missouri","USA","On Thursday morning, August 5, 2010, in Gray Summit, Missouri, traffic slowed in the approach to an active work zone on eastbound Interstate 44 (1-44), as motor vehicles merged from the closed left lane to the right lane. A 2007 Volvo truck-tractor with no trailer was traveling eastbound in the right lane and had slowed or stopped behind traffic. About 10: 11 a.m. central daylight time, a 2007 GMC Sierra extended cab pickup truck merged from the left to the right lane and struck the rear of the Volvo tractor. This collision was the first in a series of three. A convoy of two school buses from St. James High School, St. James, Missouri, was traveling eastbound in the right lane of 1-44, approaching the slowed traffic and the collision ahead. Their destination was the Six Flags St. Louis amusement park in Eureka, Missouri. The lead bus was a 71-passenger school bus, occupied by 23 passengers. Following closely behind the lead bus was a 72-passenger school bus, occupied by 31 passengers. Seconds after the lead bus passed a motorcoach that had pulled over and stopped on the shoulder, it struck the rear of the GMC pickup. This collision-the second in the series-pushed the pickup forward, overturning it onto the back of the Volvo tractor. The front of the lead bus was ramped upward, as it came to rest on top of the GMC pickup and the Volvo tractor. Moments later, the following school bus struck the right rear of the lead bus.

As a result of this accident sequence, the driver of the GMC pickup and one passenger seated in the rear of the lead school bus were killed. Atotal of35 passengers from both buses, the 2 bus drivers, and the driver of the Volvo tractor received injuries ranging from minor to serious. Eighteen people were uninjured.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of the initial Gray Summit collision was distraction, likely due to a text messaging conversation being conducted by the GMC pickup driver, which resulted in his failure to notice and react to a Volvo tractor that had slowed or stopped in response to a queue that had developed in a work zone. The second collision, between the lead school bus and the GMC pickup, was the result of the bus driver's inattention to the forward roadway due to excessive focus on a motorcoach parked on the shoulder of the road. The final collision was due to the driver of the following school bus not maintaining the recommended minimum distance from the lead school bus in the seconds preceding the accident. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the lack of forward collision warning systems on the two school buses.

As a result of this investigation, the NTSB urges the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to take action on four previously issued safety recommendations that were intended to prevent accidents and save lives. The two reiterated and reclassified safety recommendations address the placement of video event recorders (VER) in all heavy commercial vehicles and motor carrier review of that information. In addition, the NTSB reiterates two safety recommendations on the medical oversight of interstate commercial drivers.","2012-02-08T05:00:00Z","State of Alabama | Open - Acceptable Response | NA;
